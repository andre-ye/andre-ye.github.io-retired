# Books

Long-form writings
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

I have published one book and am currently concurrently writing two more. Books allow me to explore topics and ideas in long form without the restrictions of article format. I like to take nontraditional approaches to demonstrating concepts or ideas in my books, and I am interested in the pedagogy of computer science (and particularly machine learning) education and communication.
