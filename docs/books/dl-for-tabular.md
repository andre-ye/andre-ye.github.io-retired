## Book Description 

Deep learning is one of the most powerful tools in the modern artificial intelligence landscape. While having been predominantly applied to highly specialized image, text, and signal datasets, this book synthesizes and presents novel deep learning approaches to a seemingly unlikely domain – tabular data. Whether for finance, business, security, medicine, or countless other domain, deep learning can help mine and model complex patterns in tabular data – an incredibly ubiquitous form of structured data.

Part I of the book offers a rigorous overview of machine learning principles, algorithms, and implementation skills relevant to holistically modeling and manipulating tabular data. Part II studies five dominant deep learning model designs – Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Attention and Transformers, and Tree-Rooted Networks – through both their ‘default’ usage and their application to tabular data. Part III compounds the power of the previously covered methods by surveying strategies and techniques to supercharge deep learning systems: autoencoders, deep data generation, meta-optimization, multi-model arrangement, and neural network interpretability. Each chapter comes with extensive visualization, code, and relevant research coverage.

_Modern Deep Learning for Tabular Data_ is one of the first of its kind – a wide exploration of deep learning theory and applications to tabular data, integrating and documenting novel methods and techniques in the field. This book provides a strong conceptual and theoretical toolkit to approach challenging tabular data problems.

## USPs
1. The link between deep learning and tabular data has not been seriously explored at an advanced level in the market, despite tabular data being one of the most important and common forms of data in standard data science contexts. Our book will be one of or the first book dedicated towards a rigorous and wide exploration of deep learning applications to tabular data, documenting novel methods and techniques. 
2. Besides presenting many well-developed and older concepts similar to other books in the market, our book is uniquely characterized by a focus on modern ideas and methods developed in recent deep learning advancements. 
3. Most books of similar categories do not focus on applying the skills taught in the content to real-world applications. Our book will have multiple case studies which demonstrate how the presented techniques can be used in real-life contexts like business and medicine. 
4. The book looks critically upon its own content to maximize user success, developing the user’s understanding of when deep learning is or isn’t a useful tool in various contexts rather than presenting the methods without the use case context.
