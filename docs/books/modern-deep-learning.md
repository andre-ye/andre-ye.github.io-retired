## Pitch and Introduction

In spring of 2020, I was approached by Celestin Suresh John, acquisition editor of machine learning topics at Apress/Springer Nature, with an offer to write a book. I wrote up a book proposal in about two weeks, which was approved by the Apress editorial board. I spent the summer working several hours a day on the book - writing content, running and organizing code, producing visualizations, emailing paper authors, responding to revisions and comments by reviewers. The result: a 7-chapter, 450-page book that - in my opinion, anyway - takes a novel, underrepresented perspective on modern deep learning developments.

Much has been written about deep learning, most of it adhering to what I call a *code-centric framework*. These resources, which encompass all sorts of mediums from websites to books to online courses, center concepts around code. The reason, I suspect, is largely because software is one of the most accessible tools and hence computer science learners often expect 'hands-on' experience without too much theory. However, students that develop an understanding of deep learning through code-centric frameworks restrictively tie their understanding of deep learning *concepts* to *code*. While this makes sense from a software engineering perspective (think: data structures, memory management, etc. - tied inherently to implementation), deep learning is a combination of mathematics/statistics *and* computer science. There is an inherent abstraction to deep learning that code-centric frameworks often fail to explore fully, and thus limits learners' innovative/creative capacities to engineer novel deep learning solutions.

I think of this in terms of the bias/variance paradigm introduced early to machine learning students. Consider a simple curve-fitting model: if the model has high variance, it bases its understanding of the phenomena almost completely on the known data points. The curve passes through every point, but it doesn't model the regions "in-between" (i.e. "unseen" values not in the dataset) well. This is the sort of learning I believe too strict a code-centric framework encourages. In my book, I attempt to encourage generalization in learning by emphasizing intuitive theory as a guiding framework for engineering deep learning solutions and demonstrating the versatility and freedom of deep learning implementation tools.

Broadly, my book is a documentation and organization of more recent deep learning topics that have not made it yet into the bulk of "standard" deep learning literature. Topics include self-supervised learning, model compression (pruning, quantization, weight sharing, collaborative optimization), Bayesian optimization applications to neural network design, Neural Architecture Search, and architecture design motifs.

## Case Study Papers
In an effort to ground the book and to further illuminate the wide breadth of concept applications, from the second chapter onwards each chapter features three case studies. A case study centers around a paper relevant to the chapter discussion, and gives context, a summary of the paper contributions and concepts, presents reported results and diagrams, and offers code if applicable/feasible.

Combined, the book explores 18 different papers. It was a great experience reaching out to the authors of each of these papers (even the ones that didn't reply to my request - I'm looking at you, Vivek Ramanujan; it is a pity your fascinating paper was left out). I've organized and linked the discussed papers below for your reference and exploration.
