## Book Description
From surveillance tracking systems to conversational bots, disease diagnosis to addictive content recommenders, Artificial Intelligence is playing a bigger role in our daily lives and our digital society than ever – but few people understand how it works. *Automating Minds* explores and exposes the modern Artificial Intelligence field from an insider’s perspective for the general public. 

After understanding fundamental principles in machine learning and neural networks, you’ll learn about the inner workings of important AI applications like video call background blurring, intelligent question answering systems, content recommendation on platforms like YouTube, art generation, and much more. You’ll also learn how to think critically about sources, ethics, and responses to bias and fairness in AI systems – an increasingly important topic in the field. Moreover, to move with the constantly progressing nature of research in AI, *Automating Minds* guides you through the AI research development space and how to extract high-level information from research papers for yourself instead of reading it second-hand from often incomplete popular science coverage. 

Written for a wide audience, *Automating Minds* will provide you the concepts and knowledge to understand, think about, and interact with the quickly evolving world of AI development and research more deeply.

## USPs
1. This book addresses a gap in the market: there are no books that seek to make AI accessible to the general public while not being afraid to dive into technical concepts and internal dynamics. 
2. The book uses an application-first pedagogical style, relying upon familiar AI applications the reader has likely interacted with or heard about to make concepts more accessible, relevant, and engaging. 
3. A significant section of the book is dedicated towards helping the reader obtain basic literacy with AI research literature, which allows them to keep up with AI developments and to do so directly from the primary literature rather than second-hand from often inaccurate popular science coverage.  
4. The book engages in important discussion on AI history, philosophy, and fairness/responsibility issues while remaining grounded in technical concepts and research.
