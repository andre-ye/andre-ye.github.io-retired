## Research Work

### Undergraduate Researcher, w/ Prof. Conor Mayo-Wilson, Dept. of Philosophy
*March 2023 - Present*

Planned, not settled yet

### Undergrad Researcher, w/ Prof. Ranjay Krishna & Prof. Amy Zhang, Allen School of CSE
*January 2023 - Present*

Planned

### Undergrad Researcher @ Social Futures Lab, Allen School of CSE
*February 2022 - Dec 2022*

The [Social Futures Lab](https://social.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} works towards reimagining social and collaborative systems to empower people and improve society. I am researching a novel data
annotation protocol for high-stakes image segmentation problems like pathology and medical biology to directly mark uncertainty
into the data itself rather than inferring uncertainty from model outputs second-hand, the objective being to
develop more robust and self-aware computer vision models.

### Research Intern @ Deepgram
*June 2022 - September 2022*

[Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/){:target="_blank"} develops powerful deep speech recognition APIs for developers. At Deepgram, I developed novel
curriculum training infrastructure and practices to target data contamination, correct problematic model
behavior, significantly improve convergence speed, and improve performance in some cases while training large
speech models on millions of hours of audio

### Research Lead @ Interactive Intelligence
*January 2022 - Dec 2022*

Interactive Intelligence (I2) is an independent student research group at the UW focusing on developing
human-like cognition in deep learning models. Leading the Emergent Language group to build deep learning
models which develop “their own” novel system of language generation and interpretation.

### Undergrad Researcher @ Najafian Lab, UW Medicine
*March 2021 - May 2022*

The [Najafian Lab for the Pathobiology of Kidney Diseases](https://dlmp.uw.edu/research-labs/najafian){:target="_blank"} in UW Medicine's Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology operates multiple projects investigating kidney diseases.

Worked on developing a segmentation pipeline to visually mark features on electron microscopy images of cells. Researched novel segmentation model training practices  to more effectively model biological phenomena.

<!-- ### Analytics @ UW Polling and Open Data Iniative
*July 2021 - Present*

- Served as a data analyst for the [Polling and Open Data Initiative](https://poddata.org/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Washington (PODUW), an organization that analyzes and visualizes data relating to local issues, both independently collected and in collaboration with other institutions.
- Involved in the PODUW leadership team, contributing to the development of PODUW as a major student organization on campus and open data champion in the Seattle region.
- Advocated for and led the usage of deep learning for analysts in various PODUW projects and committees. Facilitated the integration of insights discovered by deep learning with traditional statistics and visualization methods.
- Assisted with web development and upkeep. -->
