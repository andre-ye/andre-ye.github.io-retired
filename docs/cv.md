## Publishing and Writing
### Author of *Deep Learning for Tabular Data*
*November 2021 - Present*

- Currently writing a second book published with Apress, an division of Springer Nature that specializes in IT publishing. Deep Learning for Tabular Data attempts to address a critical gap in coverage of recent advancements in the application of deep learning for tabular data.

### Author of *Modern Deep Learning Design and Applications*
*May 2021 - December 2021*

- *Modern Deep Learning Design and Applications* aims to reframe how deep learning concepts and implementation are presented to be focused more on creative design rather than specific concepts and code. Learning how to design deep learning solutions rather than tying oneself to specific concepts allows one to effectively approach a wider variety of problems.
- Wrote 450+ pages worth of content, figures, and code; talked with deep learning paper authors; worked with a team of editors to produce a effective, well-written, marketable book.
- The book is available for pre-order at Barnes and Noble. Get more book information on its Apress website. The book writing has been completed and will be released March 13, 2022.

### Technical Reviewer for Data Science Books @ Packt Publishing
*November 2021 - Present*

- Testing code, determining the accuracy of author content, and making revisions and suggestions to increase clarity and communication for *Building Data Science Solutions with Anaconda*, an upcoming book published by Packt, a leading information technology publisher.

### Data Science Writer and Editor
*March 2020 - April 2021*

- Awarded the Gold and Silver Medal from KDnuggets, a leading data science site with over 700k+ visitors monthly, for writing two of the most top-viewed and top-shared articles on the platform.
- Have written over 350 data science and artificial intelligence articles here for various top data science publications. Articles have collectively been read over ten million times. Awarded Top Writer in AI and Technology by Medium.
- Contracted to write data science articles for machine learning companies and organizations like Neptune.AI.
- Served as Editor of Data Science and AI Content of The Data-Driven Investor, an online publication that delivers content to several dozen thousand readers in 95 countries daily.

## Projects
### Political Thought Bibliography Dataset
*July 2021 - September 2021*

- Worked with a collaborator to develop a bibliography of political thought from thinkers dating back to Plato. The ultimate goal of such a dataset is to provide the data-level support for deep learning models that are able to comprehend and connect with the diversity and depth of human thought.
- Developed scripts to collect speeches, books, and essay content in an automated fashion in accordance with copyright law. Cleaned and organized the dataset into a machine-readable, clean form.
- Engaged with the data science community to explore possible tasks and directions to work with the datase

### Critiq, Peer Revision Platform
- Designed and coded Critiq, a peer revision platform that matches students’ essays for quick and effective revision, with HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. Hosted with Heroku, used MySQL database and innoDB engine. Employed a variety of database and site security methods. Designed code to efficiently process essays.
- Built and deployed a machine learning recommendation system to best match users’ essays, optimizing performance with constraints on response time and computing capability. Used a subset-based matrix factorization to predict the ratings matched users would give each other.
- Embedded trackers into site code to measure user acquisition and retention; used data analysis and machine learning methods to analyze visitor and user data.
