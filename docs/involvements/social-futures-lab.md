The [Social Futures Lab](https://social.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} is based out of the Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at University of Washington. The lab is reimagining social and collaborative systems to empower people and improve society. End One of size key research areas the lab focuses on is User Empowerment and Localization: many applications and models today follow a one-size-fits-all approach, leaving marginalized groups with no recourse. Instead, research in this area attempts to design tools that give power back to end users so they can build solutions that suit them, taking into account social nuances and different perspectives.

In the Social Futures Lab, I work on designing an interface to address ambiguity and uncertainty in crowdsourced segmentation problems using Goldilocks principles. Read more about it [here](./projects/segmentation-goldilocks).
