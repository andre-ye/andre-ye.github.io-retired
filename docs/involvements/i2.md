[I2 Website](https://interactive-intelligence.github.io/){: .btn }

I2 is an environment which aims to create a community of project-driven, outcome-oriented students interested in the intersections of reinforcement learning, embodied artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. The goal is to move towards machines that learn like humans.

- I created and am the primary maintainer of the group website.
- I am an officer for I2, working alongside fellow officer Janna Hong and president Chaytan Inman.
- I am working on the [Emergent Language project](https://interactive-intelligence.github.io/projects/emergent-lang) alongisde Alec Bunn and Yegor Kuznetsov.
