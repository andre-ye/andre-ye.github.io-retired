I2 is an environment which aims to create a community of project-driven, outcome-oriented students interested in the intersections of reinforcement learning, embodied artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. The goal is to move towards machines that learn like humans.

- I created and am maintaining the group website.
- I am working on the [Synthetic Languages/Communicating Models Project](https://interactive-intelligence.github.io/projects/synthetic-languages) alongisde Alec Bunn and Yegor Kuznetsov.

Talks & Presentations
- I delivered a brief talk "NNs as Minds" at an I2 meeting, a quick exploration of several deep learning techniques and methods that can be interpreted as contributing towards a facet of automated 'intelligence'. Access slides [here](https://andre-ye.github.io/files/I2/NNs as Minds.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- Alongside team members Sabrina and Marlene, we researched and presented on [Meta-Modeling and Self-Aware Networks](https://interactive-intelligence.github.io/meetings/win2022/meeting-5#meta-modeling--self-aware-networks){:target="_blank"}.
- At JC Meeting 1 Win. '22, I presented the paper ["What's Hidden in a Randomly Weighted Neural Network?"](https://interactive-intelligence.github.io/jc/win2022/meeting-1#whats-hidden-in-a-randomly-weighted-neural-network){:target="_blank"}.
- At JC Meeting 3 Win. '22, I presented the paper ["Emergence of Grounded Compositional Language in Multi-Agent Populations"](https://interactive-intelligence.github.io/jc/win2022/meeting-3#emergence-of-grounded-compositional-language-in-multi-agent-populations){:target="_blank"}.
