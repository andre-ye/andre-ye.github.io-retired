I2 is an environment which aims to create a community of project-driven, outcome-oriented students interested in the intersections of reinforcement learning, embodied artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. The goal is to move towards machines that learn like humans.

- I initialized and am maintaining & updating the group website.
- I delivered a brief talk "NNs as Minds" at an I2 meeting, a quick exploration of several deep learning techniques and methods that can be interpreted as contributing towards a facet of automated 'intelligence'.
