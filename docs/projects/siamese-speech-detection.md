# Curriculums for Speech Transcription

Internship at Deepgram
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

Deepgram builds advanced speech-to-text APIs for developers. At my 2022 internship with Deepgram, I developed curriculum learning methods for Deepgram's large-scale speech-to-text models to improve training time.

More description coming.

| I produced this project in an intensive 1.5-week sprint for an interview with Deepgram, a company building advanced speech-to-text APIs. |

Detecting when an active speaker changes in an audio file is a relatively well-studeid problem in the domain of audio deep learning. I investigate a family of time-windowed speaker change detection approaches. I demonstrate the performance of a vanilla baseline approach and propose a novel solution using the Siamese network architecture - originating from computer vision - to reframe the problem of speaker change as a problem of speaker similarity.

The code notebook is publicly available, hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/washingtongold/identifying-speaker-change){:target="_blank"} along with the associated [VoxConverse Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/washingtongold/voxconverse-dataset){:target="_blank"}.
