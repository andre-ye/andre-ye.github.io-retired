| **3/17/2022** I'm excited to work with [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/){:target="_blank"} as a research intern this summer! |

| **3/1/2022** Work on [*Deep Learning for Tabular Data*](https://andre-ye.github.io/docs/books/dl-for-tabular/) is moving quickly! First drafts for Chapter 2 "Data Preparation and Engineering" and Chapter 4 "Applying Convolutional Structures to Tabular Data" have been completed. This marks the completion of 1/3 of the total 9 chapters. |

| **2/9/2022** I will be serving as a technical reviewer for the upcoming Springer/Apress book *Deep Learning Model Optimization with Neural Network Intelligence*. |

| **2/6/2022** My book co-author Andy Wang and I have finished the first draft of Chapter 1 for my upcoming second book, [*Deep Learning for Tabular Data*](https://andre-ye.github.io/docs/books/dl-for-tabular/). It clocked at 125 pages, 29k words, 154k characters, and has taken almost three months to complete. Here's to the remaining eight! |

| **2/5/2022** My personal site is now updated to the Just the Docs theme with slight palette adjustments from the original Academic Pages theme. The new theme has more specialized styling and organization tools. This site will continue to be updated with more content and information. It's also migrated from `andre-ye.ml` to `andre-ye.github.io`, and my uni notes project (which has occupied `andre-ye.github.io` until now) has been moved to `andre-ye.github.io/uni`. |
