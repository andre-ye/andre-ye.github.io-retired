| **2/5/2022** My personal site is now updated to the Just the Docs theme with slight palette adjustments from the original Academic Pages theme. The new theme has more specialized styling and organization tools. This site will continue to be updated with more content and information. It's also migrated from `andre-ye.ml` to `andre-ye.github.io`, and my uni notes project (which has occupied `andre-ye.github.io` until now) has been moved to `andre-ye.github.io/uni`. |
