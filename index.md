**ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Andre.** I am majoring in philosophy, comparative history of ideas, and computer science. My research interests in deep learning include vision understanding, curriculum learning, and human-AI interaction; in philosophy: virtual labor and the phenomenology of digital spaces, with broader passions for critical theory, social epistemology, (post-)structuralism, and (post-)Marxism. Currently, I am a research assistant in the **Social Futures Lab**. I also TA for an English courses at the UW and am a food server at McDonald's. My email is `andreye at uw dot edu`.
