<br>

**ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Andre.** I am a philosophy and computer science major at the University of Washington. I am interested in exploring the epistemology of deep learning algorithms, particularly with respect to 'deep pedagogy', adaptive curriculum design, and the potential of such models to develop subjectivity, disagreement, opinions, and bias. The relationship between theoretical and inductive ('practical') discoveries in deep learning and AI ethics and regulation also interests me. Previously, I built deep computer vision models for medical pathology at the Najafian Lab. Currently, I am researching a novel data annotation protocol at the Social Futures Lab which directly structures domain uncertainty into the markup and therefore hopefully a) reduces annotation uncertainty and b) allows for more robust model training. I am also looking forward to research in the philosophy department in the near future. Additionally, I enjoy writing essays and books on a variety of topics in artificial intelligence, philosophy, and literature. My email is `andreye at uw dot edu`.

| **8/6/2022** My book co-author Alec Bunn and I are starting work on my upcoming third book, [Artificial Intelligence: An Accessible Approach]. The book is aimed at a general audience and attempts to help address the increasingly problematic AI literacy gap by providing knowledge of the ideas, structures, and algorithms which power digital and physical applications everywhere. |

| **7/30/2022** My book co-author Andy Wang and I have finished all twelve chapters for my upcoming second book, [*Deep Learning for Tabular Data*](https://andre-ye.github.io/docs/books/dl-for-tabular/). We anticipate to finish our second reviews and to hand off the manuscript to the production team by mid-September. |

| **5/28/2022** I will be leaving the Najafian Lab at the University of Washington after one year and three months! Thank you to Dr. Behzad Najafian and David Smerkous for an awesome experience. |

| **4/18/2022** My article "The Wartime State and the Cigarette: Darkness and Temporality in *Pale Horse, Pale RIder*" has been [published](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00144940.2022.2063706){:target="_blank"} in *The Explicator*! |

| **4/13/2022** I have completed technical review of the Apress book *Deep Learning Model Optimization with Neural Network Intelligence*. Keep your eye out for its release soon! |

| **4/10/2022** I have completed technical review of the Packt book *Building Data Science Solutions with Anaconda*. Keep your eye out for its release soon! |

| **4/4/2022** I am grateful to announce that my essay "The Wartime State and the Cigarette: Darkness and Temporality in *Pale Horse, Pale Rider*", an analysis of the role of the cigarette as representing the metaphysics of the wartime state, has been accepted for publication in *The Explicator*. |

<!-- | **4/3/2022** I will be authoring the course *Data Science for Cybersecurity* with the International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants (EC-Council). The course is expected to be finished by mid-summer of this year. | -->

| **3/26/2022** I will be TAing for CSE 163 (Intermediate Data Programming) with Prof. Hunter Schafer this spring quarter. |

| **3/17/2022** I'm excited to work with [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/){:target="_blank"} as a research intern this summer! |

| **3/1/2022** Work on [*Deep Learning for Tabular Data*](https://andre-ye.github.io/docs/books/dl-for-tabular/) is moving quickly! First drafts for Chapter 2 "Data Preparation and Engineering" and Chapter 4 "Applying Convolutional Structures to Tabular Data" have been completed. This marks the completion of 1/3 of the total 9 chapters. |

| **2/9/2022** I will be serving as a technical reviewer for the upcoming Springer/Apress book *Deep Learning Model Optimization with Neural Network Intelligence*. |

| **2/6/2022** My book co-author Andy Wang and I have finished the first draft of Chapter 1 for my upcoming second book, [*Deep Learning for Tabular Data*](https://andre-ye.github.io/docs/books/dl-for-tabular/). It clocked at 125 pages, 29k words, 154k characters, and has taken almost three months to complete. Here's to the remaining eight! |

| **2/5/2022** My personal site is now updated to the Just the Docs theme with slight palette adjustments from the original Academic Pages theme. The new theme has more specialized styling and organization tools. This site will continue to be updated with more content and information. It's also migrated from `andre-ye.ml` to `andre-ye.github.io`, and my uni notes project (which has occupied `andre-ye.github.io` until now) has been moved to `andre-ye.github.io/uni`. |
